This talk was delivered as an **oral presentation** at IcAUMS 2025 in April 2025.  
It introduced the application of **persistent homology** and topological data analysis (TDA) in the context of magnetic materials and skyrmion systems.

The session explored how topological descriptors can reveal hidden structures in spin systems.
