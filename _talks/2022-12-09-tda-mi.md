This talk was given as an **oral presentation** at the **TDA-MI Workshop 2022** in December 2022.  
The workshop was held in a hybrid format, both online and on-site at Okayama University.

The presentation introduced the use of **topological data analysis (TDA)** to investigate the **domain structure during magnetization reversal** in non-oriented electrical steel.  
The method provided a new perspective on how persistent homology can extract meaningful patterns from complex magnetic configurations.
