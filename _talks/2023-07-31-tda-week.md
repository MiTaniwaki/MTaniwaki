This poster was presented at **TDA Week 2023**, held at **Kyoto University** in August 2023.

The work focused on applying the **extended Landau free energy model** to analyze the **magnetization reversal process** of non-oriented electrical steel.  
It highlighted how theoretical modeling combined with topological insights can deepen our understanding of soft magnetic materials used in industrial applications.
