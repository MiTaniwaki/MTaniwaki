This talk was presented as an **oral presentation** at the **70th JSAP (Japan Society of Applied Physics) Spring Meeting 2023**, held in March 2023 at Sophia University's Yotsuya Campus in Tokyo.

The presentation focused on the **magnetization reversal process** in non-oriented electromagnetic steel sheets.  
A theoretical approach using the **extended Ginzburg-Landau (eX-GL) model** was proposed to interpret domain evolution during reversal, contributing to the understanding of soft magnetic materials for industrial applications.
