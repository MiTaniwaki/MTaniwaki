This presentation was given as an **oral talk** at **Intermag 2023**, held in May 2023 at the Sendai International Center in Japan.

The talk explored a theoretical model for understanding the **magnetization reversal process** in non-oriented electromagnetic steel sheets using an **extended Landau free energy approach**.
