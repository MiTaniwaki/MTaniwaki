excerpt: 'This paper investigates high-frequency magnetic losses using machine learning and topological data analysis (TDA). By analyzing spin dynamics in non-oriented electrical steel, the study reveals how excess loss components can be understood and predicted via interpretable ML models and persistent homology.'

This study presents a **physics-aware machine learning framework** for evaluating **excess loss mechanisms** in high-frequency magnetization processes. By combining **topological data analysis (TDA)** and **feature-based modeling**, the work provides a new lens for understanding complex magnetic dynamics, especially in industrial electrical steel systems.
