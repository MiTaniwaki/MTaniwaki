This paper presents a **frequency-sensitive method** for quantifying coercivity in soft magnetic materials using **persistent homology**. By analyzing the evolution of magnetic domain structures through the **magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE)**, the work links topological descriptors with coercive force and iron loss — essential metrics for modern magnetic materials.
